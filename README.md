# React Practice Tasks

A set of practice tasks based on Martin's React lectures.  
The exercises are intentionally small and focus on core concepts rather than building full applications.

## Topics covered

- Functional components and props
- Component composition
- Basic layout and styling in React

## Stack

- React (function components)
- Vite (dev server & bundling)
- Plain CSS

## Running locally

npm install
npm run dev
```
